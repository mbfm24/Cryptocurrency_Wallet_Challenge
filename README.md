# Cryptocurrency Wallet Challenge

For this Challenge, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer in order to do the following:

- Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using your mnemonic seed phrase (which you created earlier in the module).

- Fetch and display the account balance associated with your Ethereum account address.

- Calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction, including the gas estimate, that pays a Fintech Finder candidate for their work.

- Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain.

- Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

- Once you receive the transactionâ€™s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details.
